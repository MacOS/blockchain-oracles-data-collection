    This file implements the push out-bound oracles described in

    MÃ¼hlberger, R. (2019). Integration of the real world to the blockchain via in-bound and outbound oracles (Unpublished Master thesis).
    Department of Information Systems and Operations, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria.

    for evalution purposes.

    A push out-bound oracle is a software artifact that retrieves data from the blockchain (out-bound) triggered
    by an on-chain event (push).
