/**
    This script implements the on-chain component of the push in-bound oracle as described in M端hlberger for evalution purposes.

    A push inbound oracle is a software artifact that writes data to the blockchain (in-bound) triggered
    by an off-chain event (pull).

    It is used to evalute the push inbound oracle, push outbound oracle, and the pull outbound oracle.
