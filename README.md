# Foundational Oracle Patterns 
This GitHub repository contains code, which was used for the following paper:
Roman Mühlberger, Stefan Bachhofner, Eduardo Castello Ferrer, Claudio Di Ciccio, Ingo Weber, Maximilian Wöhrer, and Uwe Zdun (2020): 
Foundational Oracle Patterns. International Conference on Business Process Management. **This paper is currently under review!**

# Directory Explanations
[apps](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/apps)

Contains the QR code application as described in the paper.

[evaluation](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/evaluation)

Contains python and R scripts, which were used to analyse the collected data from the communication between oracles and the blockchain.

[oracles](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/oracles)

Contains python code for the oracles as described in the paper. However, the code in this direcotry
is one particular (centralized and Ethereum-tailored) implementation of the proposed oracle patterns, and are therefore by no means the only way how they can be implemented.

[solidity](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/solidity)

Contains the solidity code for the two smart contracts "arrival" and "customer".

[test](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/test)

Contains some tests for the code in the _oracles_ directory.
