# Directory Explanations
[evaluation](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/evaluation)

Contains the python and R code that was used to analyse the collected data on the proposed oracles.

[oracles](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/oracles)

Contains the python code for the proposed oracles. In other words, the code in this direcotry
is one particular instantiation of the proposed oracle patterns, and are therefore by no means the only way how they
can be implemented.

[solidity](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/solidity)

Contains the solidity code for the two smart contracts arrival and customer.

[test](https://github.com/MacOS/blockchain-oracles-data-collection/tree/master/test)

Contains some tests for the code in _oracles_ directory.
